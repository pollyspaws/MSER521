                    strives to deepen the connection between people and
                    nature in NYC by increasing access, providing education, and building the parks workforce. Through
                    research, partnerships, and advocacy, we ensure that urban natural areas are healthy and thriving
                    and that their benefits reach all New Yorkers.
